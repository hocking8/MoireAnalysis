The code in this repository is used for fitting moirés and atomic lattices as measured using 
torsional force microscopy (TFM) scans taken on a Bruker Icon AFM. Can be applied to other
SPM techniques for probing moirés or atomic lattices quite easily. Code needs to be adjusted
for reading in scans from other instruments.

Notebook file is fairly well commented. 

To do:
Currently it can only process square scans (same # pixels as # of lines). Needs to be optimized.
