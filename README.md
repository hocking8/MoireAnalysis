Notebook file is fairly well commented. 

To do:
Currently it can only process square scans. There is some mix-up in the x and y for the scan_size and 
scan_shape parameters (one is x, y and the other is y, x). I have to go through manually and figure out 
where the issues are, but I haven't done it yet.
